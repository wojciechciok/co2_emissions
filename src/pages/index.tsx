              For 250 years we have been burning coal, oil, and gas. We have
              thereby increased the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere by 40%.
              And we are now just starting to experience the climate impacts
              that we have already triggered. To curtail global warming in the
              long run, we must not even emit half of the CO2 we have produced
              so far. The object to limit global warming well below 2¬∞C, that
              was decided at the 2015 UN Climate Conference in Paris, is
              otherwise not accomplishable.

              Climate change is primarily a problem of too much carbon dioxide
              (CO2) in the atmosphere. This carbon overload is caused mainly
              when we burn fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas or cut down and
              burn forests. There are many heat-trapping gases (from methane to
              water vapor), but CO2 puts us at the greatest risk of irreversible
              changes if it continues to accumulate unabated in the atmosphere.

              CO2 has contributed more than any driver to climate change between
